<h1><a href="https://mistysystem.com/">Misty Programming Language:</a>Misty Machine Code</h1>
<h2>Misty Machine</h2>
<p>The Misty Machine is an abstract executor of Misty executables. It could be directly implemented in hardware, and perhaps someday it will, but in the meantime, it is used to define an intermediate representation that can be interpreted or fed to backend code generators for real machines.</p>
<h2>Misty Assembly Language</h2>
<p>The format of Misty machine code is JSON. A JSON object contains fields that describe various aspects of the program, including an <code>instructions</code> field.</p>
<p>The <code>instructions</code> field contains an array containing labels and instructions.</p>
<p>Labels are the targets of branch instructions. Labels are encoded as simple text literals.</p>
<p>Instructions describe a unit of work. Instructions are encoded as records, including an <code>op</code> field with a value text that names a machine operation. Instruction records can also include up to three operand fields, with values that are tokens. The names and meanings if the operands depends on the op. The use of tokens as operands facilitates debugging and error reporting.</p>
<pre>{
    name: "your_name_here",
    data: {...}
    instructions: [
        "label",
        {
            op: ...,
            x: ...,
            y: ...,
            z: ...
        },
        ....
    ]
}</pre>
